# PID Project

## What is out project?
Our project is a wheel box controlled by PID. It will work similar to cruise control speeding up or slowing down the based on the set value. We will choose this value with a rotary encoder and an LCD screen. We hope to keep this project simple but effective and to sharpen the PID over out time period. 

## Schedule 
CAD: 4/24 or week of 
Code: 6/1
Assembly: 5/10 
Documentation: 5/20
due date: June 1rst 

For the CAD it was fairly simple and I got it done by the time limit. There was a couple of problems I ran into, the main one was the T-slot joints. The T-slot tool was't working like I thought it would and it was making the bolts to close to the end and it was hard to find the right screw length. I ended up importing a T-slot from a different studio earlier in the year because I knew it would work but it was much less efficient.

## Description
For this project we were assigned to make a project using PID (Porportional, Integral, Derivative) which we used to control a variable. The requirements was to use a 6AA battery pack and include a power switch and LED. We chose to do a wheel box to demonstrate the PID similar to cruise control. This project utilizes Dylan's code skills for the most part and Jinho's CAD skills.

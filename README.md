# PID Project

## What is out project?
Our project is a wheel box controlled by PID. It will work similar to cruise control speeding up or slowing down the based on the set value. We will choose this value with a rotary encoder and an LCD screen. We hope to keep this project simple but effective and to sharpen the PID over out time period.

## Description
For this project we were assigned to make a project using PID (Porportional, Integral, Derivative) which we used to control a variable. The requirements was to use a 6AA battery pack and include a power switch and LED.
